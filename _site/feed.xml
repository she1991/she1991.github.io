The task was an exploration of possible big-data sources that could inform future policy decisions. For this pilot project, Child Marriage was chosen as the topic of interest and Wikipedia as the big-data source. The objective being, establishing methods and verifying the ways by which Wikipedia as a big-data source could be explored and understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wanted to answer questions like : are some aspects of child marriage fiercely debated? Demographic aspects of its participants? Are some language wikis more comprehensive than others etc.? I also looked into the dynamics of socially generated content of how trolls, vandals and editors protecting their turf interacted. The conclusions from this study would be applied to actual policy decisions on Child Marriage and this was my first experience dealing with something of this scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I build exploratory data analysis tools and visualizations that would go on top of them. PyWikiBot, a python library was used to build the crawlers that gathered content for analysis. The scrips have helped establish Wikipedia as a viable big-data source, while the visualizations like ‘edit-wars’ between wiki participants, seasonal edd and flows of the page traffic and the network analysis bring forth a broader picture.&lt;/p&gt;

This personal project is me dipping my toes into developing a lean product. The void is quiet easy to see, most offerings of PDF to online flip-book are either paid and/or based on flash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I identified this void and decided to bridge it with a PDF to flip-book renderer based upon the very popular and awesome PDFjs by Mozilla. By peeling off and tweaking the rendering layers of PDFjs, I created TurnPDF.js which rendered pages not as usual PDF with a scroll bar; but as an interactive flip book which users could flip by dragging the page edges over. Because the project is a fork of PDFjs, it promises the same dependable under-the-hood abilities that engineers at Mozilla have built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can check TurnPDF.js code at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/she1991/turnpdf.js&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, it is a work in progress.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">TurnPDF.js is a personal project, I have always fancied creating a full product all by myself.

It became critical to offer this website in at least UN’s major national languages for deeper penetration. While developers restructured the website to use an English .JSON file for all content references, constructing these .JSON files would delay the localized releases of MyWorld2015.org substantially. UNDP Knowledge and Innovation team initially strategized to divide the 9 language workload of manual labor between 3 volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience with Python automation helped UNDP consider an automation based strategy instead. I helped automate the localization process using crowd-sourced translations. Scripts I wrote automated the 4 hour drudgery of copy-pasting translated bits into the master template .JSON file to barely seconds. The whole industrialization of the process achieved such speedup, that MyWorld2015.org was offered in 16 languages instead of just 9 as planned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; The work was featured in UN Volunteer’s online news letter for June 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20160117094958/https://www.onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/resources/newsletter_june_2013.html&quot;&gt; click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">MyWorld2015.org survey platform was launched in January 2013.

The consultation made several financial and design optimizations to the donation flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central proposal was made, of a card based donation amount selection interface that informs the donor exactly how the donated amount will be used. This is a powerful tool in establishing the direct impact of donation and helps the donor anchor his donation to a direct impact. CCF has implemented all the recommendations. The project was awarded as the best Credit Suisse Action Learning Project for 2015 Analysts.&lt;/p&gt;
