Credit Suisse is a close partner of CCF and as part of ‘Action Learning Project’ for graduate analysts from across the APAC region, a team of 6 analysts including myself worked with CCF founder Alexander Bob to understand and re-work its donation process. The consultation made several financial and design optimizations to the donation flow.

A central proposal was made, of a card based donation amount selection interface that informs the donor exactly how the donated amount will be used. This is a powerful tool in establishing the direct impact of donation and helps the donor anchor his donation to a direct impact. CCF has implemented all the recommendations. The project was awarded as the best Credit Suisse Action Learning Project for 2015 Analysts.
