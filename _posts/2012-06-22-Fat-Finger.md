It refers to the unintentional triggering of an interface target. Fat fingers have been intensely studied in the field of finance as well, they have been famous for wiping out millions in a single erroneous trade.[2]</p><p name="7ef7" id="7ef7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1.2 Is this relevant to consumer user interfaces?</strong></p><p name="74f6" id="74f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While a fat finger error on a consumer app may not launch a missile or wipe out millions ($1000 maybe?), it can lead to a frustrated user experience. Fat finger errors can cause some embarrassing moments, data loss, unintentional sharing or a generally sloppy user experience. This issue of fat fingers is all the more relevant to mobile touch interfaces since the touch screen is prone to movement on a bumpy ride and similarly the touch input can be off-target for many reasons. Also considering that some mobile applications may be used by people wearing gloves or using other devices (pencil stylus, fingertip-stylus) etc. make this an important enough topic from a usability perspective.</p><p name="5cf8" id="5cf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">1.3 Human factors in modern digital product design</strong></p><img class="center-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*hq8AoDfSYsMDhrO9EHko2w.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*hq8AoDfSYsMDhrO9EHko2w.png">

<p name="e3e9" id="e3e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Human factors have found very little room in modern consumer oriented digital world, until lately with the advent of newer interaction platforms like VR and smartwatches. Traditionally human factors and ergonomics have found use in military or highly scientific projects and in design of consumer hardware; very little has been written about their use in consumer software (predominantly keyboard design research). A simple google search <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">‘Human Factors in Digital Product Design’</em> returns very little in terms of non-academic or popular literature. This work sheds light on how an interface designed for an average user may not be usable for a basketball player&#8202;—&#8202;and how we can test our designs for these usability errors.</p><h3 name="365f" id="365f" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">2.

Modern tools (especially Sketch and Framer) have made it possible to mix design and engineering, develop a common platform for communication between designers and developers. There is very little documentation about an automated testing toolchain, however there is a rich ecosystem of Sketch plugins[3] and I am guessing that design teams have developed their own processes with some automation. A 2014 article by Sketch discusses a direction towards incorporating such automated processes.[4]</p><p name="e2cb" id="e2cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2.2 Industry design standards related to fat finger errors</strong></p><p name="15dd" id="15dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are aware about the many <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">‘design languages’ </em>developed by technology firms to standardize the UX and UI of their digital products.</p><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FnUTWLJSXkT8WC-KEtm6Rg.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FnUTWLJSXkT8WC-KEtm6Rg.png">Principles of Google’s Material Design Language.[10]
<blockquote name="bce9" id="bce9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--figure">The term “Design Language” is used to describe the overall visual design of a digital product.[5]</blockquote><p name="1403" id="1403" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Some notable examples (not an exhaustive list) of design languages include Google’s material design ideology[6], AirBnB’s design language[7], Apple’s human interface guidelines[8] etc.</p><p name="b3b3" id="b3b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of the many points these guidelines make, they have defined minimum clearances between and touch target sizes. Different design languages define different minimum target sizes and clearances, they also use different unites like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">pts</em> or <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">dps</em> etc. These are independent of the screen resolution and thus device agnostic&#8202;—&#8202;Sebastian Gabriel [11] does a great job at explaining this concept.</p><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*47Hl902WUzWrgil-YaAAdA.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*47Hl902WUzWrgil-YaAAdA.png">Design guidelines for touch targets a) Apple human interface guidelines b) Google Material Design c) Microsoft.

<p name="538e" id="538e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">You can draw many similarities between these design languages and more restrictive military human-factors design practices like MIL-STD-46855.[12]</p><p name="0ba6" id="0ba6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An academic research paper on the topic of touch target sizes, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">‘Target Size Study for One-Handed Thumb Use on Small Touchscreen Devices’[13] has </em>specified an ideal touch target size of 9mm and you can see the mention of this very number in Google’s Material Design guidelines.</p><p name="6508" id="6508" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps all these design languages could be codified and enforced on every design iteration - perhaps this concept could be extended to form an automated product design audit.</p><p name="82a9" id="82a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2.3 Isn’t avoiding Fat-Finger zones obvious?

As the size of your design projects grows and newer features are added, it is possible that certain touch targets may have been moved around to accommodate newer features.</p><blockquote name="9925" id="9925" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">It is not humanly possible to verify the spacing between touch targets on every design iteration or every little change in a large multi-device project.</blockquote><p name="eb1b" id="eb1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Also, responsive designs may shift around and Fat-Finger error zones might pop up on certain configurations. There are many reasons due to which our careful consideration for target clearances may be ignored or forgotten. Having a tool that does this validation for your may help enforce an organization’s design language throughout all its projects consistently. The tool will help flag violations and bring them to our attention proactively and early in the design process.</p><h3 name="bb05" id="bb05" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">3.

<p name="551c" id="551c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This app is supposed to make the lives of regional dev-ops bosses a bit easier. Often major server changes etc in production environments need approvals from dev-ops managers who are aware of the bigger picture and the domino effects of shutting down a server. This also means, they may need to explicitly grant their consent to major production environment changes&#8202;—&#8202;sometimes in the dead of the night or in the middle of their morning commute.</p><p name="2e13" id="2e13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The app functions as a simple queue with approve and reject buttons for every critical or urgent approval request that cannot wait. Fat finger issues here may lead to the rejection or approval of a wrong request. The fact that this app may be used at odd times or by a very sleepy dev-ops managers, are high. We thus tested the user interface and the layout of our touch targets to check if they survive a very sloppy and fat-fingered user simulation using this tool.</p>

<p name="e9be" id="e9be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">To really understand fat-finger errors, we should have a quick review of how touch screens encode our finger taps into pixel co-ordinates on the device. On your left is an ideal representation of a contact patch on a touch device. The <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">‘centroid’</em> represented in red is the pixel co-ordinate approximation that the touchscreen hardware guesses.</p><blockquote name="6183" id="6183" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Like all analog to digital conversions, this may include errors in estimation.</blockquote><p name="2f48" id="2f48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">The errors occur in the direction of the 4 cardinal axes&#8202;—&#8202;distorting the centroid position in the 2D space.</p><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1hd_q8jQgAKKJZcSRTybJQ.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1hd_q8jQgAKKJZcSRTybJQ.png"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*1hd_q8jQgAKKJZcSRTybJQ.png"&gt;</noscript>
Three realistic cases of touch screen contacts. Centroids (in red) of the contact patch (in teal) that are estimated by the touchscreen hardware.
<p name="f81a" id="f81a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The figure above shows three examples of more realistic scenarios of contact patches on a touch interface. When your skin touches the device, it leaves an irregular contact patch. This irregular contact is then processed by the touch screen system to approximate it’s centroid&#8202;—&#8202;the pixel you intended to touch. Errors in approximation are only natural, the device makes a best guess at selecting the pixel co-ordinate for clicking.</p><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*Znx8wIuecDnBRgFIVM9FnQ.png" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*Znx8wIuecDnBRgFIVM9FnQ.png"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*Znx8wIuecDnBRgFIVM9FnQ.png"&gt;</noscript>
An example of the centroid (red filled dot) being mis-approximated by the device. This leads to a tap on the adjacent touch target instead of the intended&nbsp;target.
<p name="ce25" id="ce25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The image on your left describes a simpler scenario which this system will flag as a fat-finger prone region. As the plugin simulates user taps along the edges of the touch target under consideration&#8202;—&#8202;‘T<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">est Target</em>’<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>here, it also simulates taps considering encoding errors in the X and Y axes. Here we see that the contact patch when experiencing an error in the negative X axis direction takes place, it accidentally triggers a touch on the adjacent touch target. These risk situations are then marked with a red circle by the plugin.</p><p name="7116" id="7116" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The tap simulation can be described as follows:</strong></p><ol class="postList"><li name="79dd" id="79dd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">For every point along the edges of a touch target.</li><li name="d827" id="d827" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Simulate a tap at (x, y) where x and y are co-ordinates of the point on the edge.</li><li name="b4c0" id="b4c0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Simulate taps at: (x, y +/- y-error), (x +/- x-error, y) and (x +/- x-error, y +/- y-error) co-ordinates.</li></ol><blockquote name="d709" id="d709" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--li">The encoding errors are magnified if the user is wearing gloves or anything that interferes with the user’s natural interaction.

The possibility of a fat-finger error cause by tapping on the edges of a large touch target are far less than if the target was smaller in size, because determining the central-mass of the touch target becomes easier as it’s size increases. This intuitively follows Fitts’s law [14].</p><p name="9376" id="9376" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The proximity of two large touch targets has little bearing on increasing the risk of fat-finger errors as it is very unlikely that the user may choose to tap the edges of a large touch target instead of its easily identifiable central-mass.</p><p name="de40" id="de40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Lastly, the head map generated by the Fat-Finger plugin is a recommendation. It is up to the designers to judge the necessity of a rearrangement or redesign of the touch targets in violation.</p><h3 name="1834" id="1834" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">4.

An example of an eye tracking study conducted on a Wiki&nbsp;page.
<p name="115d" id="115d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The chief inspiration for the output heat-map was taken from eye-tracking studies</strong> which superimpose an eye movement heat-map on top of the interface being studied. This lets the reader of the heat-map easily identify ‘<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hot</em>’ areas and the underlying user interface elements. Unlike eye-tracking, where the significance of data-point in the visualization lies on a spectrum of continuous values&#8202;—&#8202;the fat-finger identification is a binary outcome. Either, tapping a given point on the edge of a touch target will accidentally trigger the adjacent target or it will not.</p><p name="a59e" id="a59e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, successive points along the edge of the touch target may or may not yield into fat-finger errors. To allow the observer to identify such cases, the offending points were highlighted with filled circle the size of a contact-patch. These highlights are red but are filled with a color which has set transparency (alpha value). As multiple highlights are drawn, sections with a very high possibility of fat-finger errors appear ‘<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">redder</em>’ because multiple adjacent highlights are superimposed on each other.</p><p name="2a7f" id="2a7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Representation of the ‘<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">tap</em>’ or the human touch on the interface is done with red filled circle the size of an ideal index finger contact-patch. Further improvements to the fat-finger plugin may include testing for thumb use and its equivalent representation etc.</p><p name="2a0c" id="2a0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Care was taken to ensure that the heat-maps generated by the fat-finger test would not interfere with the design layout or structure, that they could be easily deleted. The plugin creates the heat-map above all the art-boards and can be easily removed.</p><p name="c0a8" id="c0a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">4.4 Creating a minimum viable product (MVP)</strong></p><p name="f3cf" id="f3cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Developing the plugin was not as much as a design or engineering challenge as it was challenge in finding the right resources and guidance. The plugin was conceived, designed and developed over a period of 10 days of on and off work. The MVP is designed to work right off the bat on Sketch v45 and up.</p><p name="7b5a" id="7b5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I spent considerable time trying to figure out functionalities that were not natively supported by Sketch API. This is proof that today’s design tools are slowly but surely moving towards a more sophisticated and integrated design practices that smoothly work between designers and front-end developers.</p><p name="a926" id="a926" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This project has contributed immensely towards my understanding of design tools and also discuss bigger ideas like design testing and its automation.</p><h3 name="bf83" id="bf83" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">5. Big Ideas and future&nbsp;work</h3><p name="481a" id="481a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">5.1 Design testing and design toolchains - inspired by software testing.</strong></p><p name="c5c3" id="c5c3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We all agree that UI designers must iterate and re-iterate their designs, working every element and pixel to perfection. Very little is said about making tools to help with this constant testing and iteration. As projects grow in size, sometimes reaching 100s of Sketch art-boards, this iteration process can become time consuming. Evaluating secondary concerns like touch target clearances, alignment preservation on all lengths of lorem-ipsum, sticking to standard margins and padding etc are very easily put on the back-burner once the design has reached certain maturity.</p><blockquote name="ce3d" id="ce3d" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">I imagine a design toolchain that continuously observes and evaluates existing design artifacts to identify any violations of established minutiae. This means automating the attention to detail that is expected from designers in to a toolchain.</blockquote><p name="d17d" id="d17d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">An example toolchain may be a pipeline of tools processing Sketch art-boards and watch for interactive targets to be right size, elements being cut out in responsive layouts, ensuring all elements are visible on device orientation change or even check for ‘<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">too many colors</em>’<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>on a given page.</p><blockquote name="0027" id="0027" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">The spell-check is a very relatable tool that is so seamlessly incorporated into our design processes. Yes, there is a plugin for&nbsp;that.</blockquote><p name="e7ef" id="e7ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">These design toolchains can be further sophisticated to identify and flag interface elements that may be hard to reach in single-handed use! The idea here is to imagine a continuous testing and integration process for our modern design workflow, borrowing the wisdom from the field of software testing. Designs can even be used to generate CSS templates, color palettes and many other useful artifacts using these design toolchains.</p><p name="1341" id="1341" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">5.2 Improvements and future work.</strong></p><p name="3543" id="3543" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The fat-finger plugin is an MVP and makes many assumptions. To begin with, the tool could be extended to simulate thumb taps which are more oblong in their contact patch footprint. The system could also use an interface so users could customize the error ratios for the tab simulation as well as the contact patch sizes.</p><p name="803c" id="803c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Future work around design testing could involve exploring existing design toolchains that have been homegrown in design and technology firms.</p><h3 name="b746" id="b746" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">6.
