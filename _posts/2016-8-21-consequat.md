I developed some moderate level features for MIXXX, an open-source DJ software. This was also my first contribution to opensource. As a contributor to the MIXXX project, I developed a context menu reset feature to reset the played counter <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/893009">(feature/bug)</a>, proposed and developed minute marker designs on a track's waveform <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/+bug/746456">(feature/bug)</a> and solved DAO issues for bulk file imports into the applications by applying transaction to the data imports, increased efficiency by a very huge factor <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/mixxx/1.9/+bug/889825">(bug)</a>.
