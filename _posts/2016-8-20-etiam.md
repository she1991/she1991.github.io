An assignment for Intelligence Gathering class taught by Dr.Lance Hayden. I modeled using random-walk approach the spread of infections in a non-homogenous population composed of adults, children and older members with each group have different assigned vulnerabilities. The model has drawn a lot of inspiration from the conventional SIR model in epidemiology.

Users can play with the visualization by attacking/infecting diferent nodes of the social graph and see the infection play out. The visualization is meant to give its users a feel of how epidemics gain momentum in a closed population.
