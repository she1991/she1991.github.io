MyWorld2015.org survey platform was launched in January 2013. It became critical to offer this website in at least UNâ€™s major national languages for deeper penetration. While developers restructured the website to use an English .JSON file for all content references, constructing these .JSON files would delay the localized releases of MyWorld2015.org substantially. UNDP Knowledge and Innovation team initially strategized to divide the 9 language workload of manual labor between 3 volunteers.

My experience with Python automation helped UNDP consider an automation based strategy instead. I helped automate the localization process using crowd-sourced translations. Scripts I wrote automated the 4 hour drudgery of copy-pasting translated bits into the master template .JSON file to barely seconds. The whole industrialization of the process achieved such speedup, that MyWorld2015.org was offered in 16 languages instead of just 9 as planned.
