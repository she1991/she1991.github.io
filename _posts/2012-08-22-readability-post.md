title: "NDC's MapIt : Game based learning for deaf kids"
subtitle: "BUILDING A DEAF FIRST GAMING EXPERIENCE"
description: "Built a deaf-first experience by working with deaf users and NDC. Informed game's design and user interface with user-research. Conducted user play-tests, ran focus-groups and demos. Also, shape-shifting into dev and art roles as needed."
timeline: "April 2016 - Present"
team_size: "9"
role: "User reasearch and experience design."
methods: "Exploratory concept (convergent & divergent) research, qualitative user research, storyboarding, game design, low and high fidelity protoyping, accessibility engineering, UI design, play testing"
client: "National Deaf Center"
lead_quote: "Deaf children need to know how their rights and identity blend into real life scenarios. NDC's Mapit is a game of the visual novel genre; that provides a safe space for players to learn to self-advocate, fail and build assertiveness. It is also the first game to be fully captioned in American Sign Language (ASL)."

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>Pepnet2's 'Mapit: What comes next' is an online educational resource for deaf children where they can learn about deaf rights, self-advocacy, self-empowerment, career planning and job readiness. <a href="http://www.pepnet.org/" target="_blank">Pepnet2</a> resources have now been decomissioned, this project is designed to serve as a replacement for Mapit's mission.</p>

<div class="sub-title"><p>Pepnet2 is essentially a repurposed compliance training module with little thought towards its young deaf audience.</p></div>
<p>The challenge was to design a game based learning offering that would teach deaf kids their rights and self-advocating these rights in a fun and engaging way. Pepnet2's MOOC style teaching methodology with long video content and quiz based assesments make it feel a lot less engaging. <blockquote>The user experience with Pepnet2 is impersonal and objective; does not capture the different voices and social nuances of real life interactions.</blockquote> </p>


<h3>The team</h3>
<p>The project Mapit is being built by the <a href="http://sagalab.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">Simulation and Game Application (SAGA) Lab</a> at University of Texas at Austin. The project is advised by the principal of the lab Prof. Paul Toprac and the co-principal of the lab Dr. Sara Abraham and Matt O'Hair (ex-co principal). The team consists of 4 artists, 2 writers, 2 technologists and myself on the user-experience and research. I also liaise with the <a href="https://www.nationaldeafcenter.org/" target="_blank">National Deaf Center</a> to manage stakeholders, provide updates and involve the NDC in key decisions.</p>

<h2>Early exploration</h2>
<p>A good chunk of early exploration consisted of <b>divergent thinking</b> exercises. The objective was to explore different genres of games and educational games that were fun to play and taught the user something. Our explorations involved conversations about games members of the labs had previously played and liked, going over the past project the lab worked on and surfing the internet for interesting games.</p>

<div class="sub-title"><p>Some serious doodling and sketching, I love sketching ideas indiscriminately on paper and pen/pencil.</p></div>
<blockquote>The most important part of this exploration was to identify game mechanics that promote self-expression and agency for the players. Self-advocacy is a central focus of NDC’s mission.</blockquote>
<p>After considering a variety of games that may provide an inspiration for possible game mechanics, zeroed down on a blend of RPG style world based and visual novel style games. With enough examples to draw from, we switched gears to <b>convergent thinking</b>. The goal now was to define our vision with examples.</p>
<p>Two games stood out as good examples to inform Mapit’s vision. <a href="http://playspent.org/" target="_blank">Spent</a>, a game of surviving on minimum wage in face of economic hardships - living paycheck to paycheck was an inspiration for Mapit’s non-judgemental tone in its in-game choices.</p>
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/spent.png"/>
<p><a href="https://fairplaygame.org/" target="_blank">Fair Play</a>, a game about discrimination and racial bias was an experience we drew from, for framing our game scenarios. It inspired the intensity and depth of Mapit - pushing the players to make tough choices independently.</p>
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fairplay.png"/>
<p>We prepared a pitch-deck and presented it to the NDC. The concept was well received and we moved ahead with presenting a rough playable prototype in the weeks that followed.</p>

<h3>Agency and self-advocacy</h3>
<p>Games are a great tools for providing a safe environment for players to try different approaches to a problem, make stupid choices or even informed one. Games eliminate the real-life time gap between action and reaction, this is helpful when we are trying to teach abstract topics like social-skills, assertiveness which may have very slow and mixed consequences in the real-world. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T39kYzzv_3Q" target="_blank">video by Extra Credits</a> succinctly explain why games are a great learning tool for developing agency, the effort behind Mapit is based on a similar philosophy towards learning.</p>
<h3>A commitment to Inclusivity and diversity</h3>
<p>From the very beginning, it was decided that the game will be designed to be inclusive to all audiences and work towards representing characters that reflect the diversity in our society. All game art would be developed with this under consideration, giving out realistic and relatable art; which meant no opulent mansions or private jets.</p>
<img style="display: block;margin: 0 auto;" width="150px" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hooded_player.png"/>
<blockquote>The representation of the player themself inside the game was a very challenging problem. We tried to obscure as many physical details of the player character as possible. As a result, it was relatable to no one; this a problem game designers often face.</blockquote>

<h2>Limits of personas</h2>
<p>The hard of hearing and hearing impaired community has an added dimension of uniqueness over on top of the traits that make you and me different from one another. Small differences in hearing-ability have very large impact on the life-experiences and self-image of a person and it is very difficult to lump this population into brackets. Often designers use personas to represent homogenous user populations that share a common goal, trait or some point of reference - this homogeneity is very difficult to apply on populations with impairments since minor variations in the nature of impairment may lead to very different persons. <blockquote>A hard of hearing person who uses an amplifier headset is very different from a completely deaf individual who again is different from a deaf individual who has been deaf since birth; in terms of both impairment and life experiences!</blockquote></p>
<p>We look at our target population on a spectrum of hearing impairment, socio-economic standing and age. Unifying the diverse experiences of deaf users by distilling their experiences into common themes such that the game covers the representation of deaf individuals across the hearing impairment spectrum. As such, we are not designing the user experience based on personas; we instead use a fluid representation of a deaf individual. The nature of the player character’s impairment or their physical representation is not discussed in the game - leaving this to the player’s own imagination.</p>
<blockquote><i>"NDC is using "deaf" in an all-inclusive manner, to include people who may identify as Deaf, deaf, deafblind, deafdisabled, hard of hearing, late-deafened, and hearing impaired. NDC recognizes that for many individuals, identity is fluid and can change over time or with setting. NDC has chosen to use one term - deaf - with the goal of recognizing experiences that are shared by all members of our diverse communities while also honoring all of our differences."</i> - National Deaf Center</blockquote>

<h2>Concept prototypes</h2>
<p>Building upon our exploratory research up until this point, the next steps were to create a concrete representation of the vision for the game so far. The game is based on a choose your own adventure style RPG where the player must collect all badges while maintaining a healthy level of money, GPA and social score. Each of these metric were selected to ensure that the player makes well rounded choices and to demonstrate that a balance of work and leisure is needed. Badges strewn across challenges are awarded when a challenge is successfully completed, think of them as in game collectibles.</p>
<h3>Simple concept art</h3>
<p>You can see the three major metrics for money, GPA and social score. The score on the right hand side is for the badges you have collected so far.</p>
