TurnPDF.js is a personal project, I have always fancied creating a full product all by myself. This personal project is me dipping my toes into developing a lean product. The void is quiet easy to see, most offerings of PDF to online flip-book are either paid and/or based on flash.

I identified this void and decided to bridge it with a PDF to flip-book renderer based upon the very popular and awesome PDFjs by Mozilla. By peeling off and tweaking the rendering layers of PDFjs, I created TurnPDF.js which rendered pages not as usual PDF with a scroll bar; but as an interactive flip book which users could flip by dragging the page edges over. Because the project is a fork of PDFjs, it promises the same dependable under-the-hood abilities that engineers at Mozilla have built.
